## Description
This app works in node.js and uses inquirer npm to take responses from the user based on which the logo will be created.
Additionally app uses tinycolor npm to validate user responses for shape and text colors.

I build this project to help automate the process of creating SVG logos for users.
My main focus for this app was to gain more experiance and hands on practice with OOP. 
In this app my priority was to use objects, classes, methods, attributes and getting better understaning on ideas of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and ploymorphism.
